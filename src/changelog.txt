Version: 2.3.0
Date: 15. 02. 2019
  Features:
    - Updated for 0.17.
  Changes:
    - Increase levels in upper two tiers of inventory size upgrades from 2 to 4, this is to compensate for the lack of toolbelt research.
    - Reduced the levels per tier of player reach from 4 to 3, the base game now has a reach of 10, instead of 6.
    - Crafting speed, player mining speed, player reach's higher tier researches now requires production instead of utility science packs.
    - Disable verbose logging by default.
  Removed:
    - Toolbelt upgrades (this is now in the base game under Options => Interface => Active quickbars).
    - Settings to disable a particular category, this setting was rather redundant and confusing.
