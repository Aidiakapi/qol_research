description=In a recent Factorio update, the developers changed the behavior of the technology tree, making these technologies visible. A modding interface request has been submitted that would allow me to hide these technologies again, but so far no response was given. For now, please ignore these, hopefully in the not too distant future, a fix will be possible.
